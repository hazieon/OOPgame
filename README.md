# Game Hackathon

For the next two days we are going to design and build our own game. It is an opportunity to cement what we've learnt about object oriented programming, as well as planning, ideating and MVP.

## Task 1 - Wed afternoon

Choose a game to recreate in code. Use disney ideation, and then break it down to the essence (MVP) and plan what classes you will need, and what state and behavior each class will need. The break each of the behaviors down to a level were you can start coding.

## Task 2 - Wed Afternoon

Put each of your classes into a trello board with a todo, doing and done column.

## Task 3 - Build Your MVP

Get the simplest possible version of your game working.

## Task 4 - Next steps

Choose what your next steps are, what functionality would make the biggest impact. If you've used alert/prompt for your MVP. Display your game on the page either with the DOM or your new canvas games.
