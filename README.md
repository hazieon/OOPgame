# Game Hackathon

We had two days to plan and build a game in JavaScript using Object Oriented Programming.
In a pair, we completed this project in week 5 of the School of Code bootcamp to practice hands on with JavaScript, OOP, classes and canvas.
We really pushed ourselves and set a challenge to build an interactive coin collecting game. 
We faced issues with Canvas and OOP classes, but overcame them with a lot of debugging.

# Play the game!
